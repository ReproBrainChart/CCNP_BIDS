## devCCNP RBC README
This is the neuroimaging dataset for the The developmental component of the Chinese Color Nest Project (devCCNP)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929321001109#:~:text=Abstract,using%20an%20accelerated%20longitudinal%20design.].
devCCNP was established to create normative charts for brain structure and function across the human lifespan, 
and link age-related changes in brain imaging measures to psychological assessments of behavior, cognition, 
and emotion using an accelerated longitudinal design. devCCNP has acquired data with three repeated measurements 
from 2013 to 2017 in Southwest University, Chongqing, China.

This version of the dataset was curated at the University of Pennsylvania by the Lifespan Informatics 
and Neuroimaging Center (PennLINC) as part of the "Reproducible Brain Chart" (RBC) Initiative. RBC seeks to aggregate, 
organize QA, process, curate, and openly disseminate many of the largest cross-sectional studies of brain development.
